# liri-node-app
The Liri-Node-App is a way to search for movies, concerts, and songs. 

Technologies used:
OMDB Movie Database API
Spotify API
Bands in Town API.


Users are able to search the different API's by using LIRI commands:

spotify-this-song followed by a song title Alllows users to search Spotify using a song title. They are then given the top 20 results including the track name, artist, album, and a privew URL.

movie-this followed by a movie titleAllows users to search the OMDB movie database and returns movie title, year it was released, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes score, country it was filmed in, lanugage, plot, and actors.

concert-this Allows users to search for a band and then returns the band's next concert venue, location, and date. 



If users do not add search critera for spotify-this-song they will be returned with a search for "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

If users do not add search critera for movie-this they will be returned with information about Mr. Nobody.
